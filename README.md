# Sneaker Classification using ResNet50
This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras project for classifying sneakers into 50 different classes using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model. The project includes data loading, visualization, data augmentation, model building, training, and evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Sneakers Classification" dataset, which is expected to be located at [/kaggle/input/sneakers-classification/sneakers-dataset/sneakers-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikolasgegenava/sneakers-classification). The dataset statistics are provided in a dataset_stats.csv file, which is loaded and visualized to understand the class distribution.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to classify sneaker images into different categories by leveraging a pre-trained ResNet50 model with fine-tuning techniques. The project includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.
